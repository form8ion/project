### Installation

```sh
$ npm install @form8ion/project --save-prod
```

### Consumption in a CLI tool

This scaffolder is intended to be used as a CLI tool, but it is left up to the
consumer to provide the actual CLI wrapper. My [sub-command](https://github.com/travi/scaffolder-sub-command)
for [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) is an example of such
a wrapper.

### Example

#### Import

```javascript
import {lift, questionNames, scaffold} from '@form8ion/project';
```

#### Execute

```javascript
await scaffold({
  decisions: {
    [questionNames.PROJECT_NAME]: 'my-project',
    [questionNames.LICENSE]: 'MIT',
    [questionNames.VISIBILITY]: 'Public',
    [questionNames.DESCRIPTION]: 'My project',
    [questionNames.GIT_REPO]: false,
    [questionNames.COPYRIGHT_HOLDER]: 'John Smith',
    [questionNames.COPYRIGHT_YEAR]: '2022',
    [questionNames.PROJECT_LANGUAGE]: 'foo'
  },
  plugins: {
    dependencyUpdaters: {
      bar: {scaffold: options => options}
    },
    languages: {
      foo: {scaffold: options => options}
    }
  }
});

await lift({
  projectRoot: process.cwd(),
  results: {},
  enhancers: {foo: {test: () => true, lift: () => ({})}},
  vcs: {}
});
```

### API

This is an opinionated scaffolder, but there are some aspects that are
configurable in order to support multiple contexts.

Takes a single options object as an argument, containing:

#### `languages` (_optional_)

provides the languages to choose from and the functions to perform the
scaffolding for the chosen language. if no languages are provided, `Other` will
be the only choice presented. Choosing `Other` will perform no language-specific
scaffolding. Official options are provided [in the awesome list](https://github.com/form8ion/awesome#languages).

__object__:

* keys: __string__ Name of the language
* values: __function__ that scaffolds language specific details
  * receives an options object as its first argument to pass along answers to
    the project-level prompts
    * `projectRoot`: __string__ path of the working directory where the CLI
      command was executed
    * `projectName`: __string__ name chosen for the project. defaults to the
      directory name.
    * `vcs`: __object__ details about the [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
      host
      * `host`: __string__ host name
      * `name`: __string__ repository name. equal to `projectName`
      * `owner`: __string__ account name on the host service for the repository
        owner. defaults to `$ git config github.user`
    * `visibility`: __string__ `Public` or `Private`. defaults to `Private`
    * `license`: __string__ identifier of the chosen [SPDX License](https://spdx.org/licenses/)
      or `UNLICENSED`
    * `ci`: __string__ name of the chosen CI service. defaults to `Travis`
    * `description`: __string__ short summary of the project

#### `vcsHosts` (_optional_)

provides the vcs hosts to choose from and the functions to perform the
scaffolding for the chosen host. if no hosts are provided, `Other` will be the
only choice presented. Choosing `Other` will perform no host-specific
scaffolding. Official options are provided [in the awesome list](https://github.com/form8ion/awesome#version-control-services).

__object__:

* keys: __string__ Name of the vcs host
* values: __object__
  * `prompt`: __function__ (_required_) prompts for host specific details
    * MUST return an object of the prompt answers, which MUST include the name
      of the account for the host that owns the repo as `repoOwner`
  * `scaffolder`: __function__ (_required_) scaffolds the host options
    * receives an options object as its first argument to pass along answers to
      the project-level prompts
      * `host`: __string__ name of the chosen host, as provided in the key of
        the `vcsHosts` object
      * `name`: __string__ name chosen for the project. defaults to the
        directory name.
      * `owner`: the account name of the owner of the repo on the host, as
        returned from the `prompt` function
      * `projectRoot`: __string__ path of the working directory where the CLI
        command was executed
      * `description`: __string__ brief summary of the project
      * `homepage`: __string__ url of the project homepage
  * `public`: __boolean__ (_optional_) whether this host should be presented
    as a public option
  * `private`: __boolean__ (_optional_) whether this host should be presented
    as a private option

#### `dependencyUpdaters` (_optional_)

provides the dependency updaters to choose from and the functions to perform the
scaffolding for the chosen updater service. if no updater services are provided,
`Other` will be the only choice presented. Choosing `Other` will perform no
updater-service-specific scaffolding. Official options are provided [in the awesome list](https://github.com/form8ion/awesome#dependency-update-services).

__object__:

* keys: __string__ Name of the dependency update service
* values: __object__
  * `scaffolder`: __function__ (_required_) scaffolds the host options
    * receives an options object as its first argument to pass along answers to
      the project-level prompts
      * `projectRoot`: __string__ path of the working directory where the CLI
        command was executed
    * `vcs`: __object__ details about the [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
      host
      * `host`: __string__ host name
      * `name`: __string__ repository name. equal to `projectName`
      * `owner`: __string__ account name on the host service for the repository
        owner. defaults to `$ git config github.user`
